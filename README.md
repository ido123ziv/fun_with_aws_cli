# fun_with_aws_cli
This repo contains `aws-cli` script with `bash` scripts to help with aws tasks that are difficult to do with the console.
Just chill in and use them with the services you use to help with day to day jobs with the cloud.

Enjoy!

To install `aws-cli` on Mac:
```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```
